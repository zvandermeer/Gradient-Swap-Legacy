# Gradient Swap Game

An infinitely replayable, procedurally generated clone of the Colours game from [Puzzledom](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/puzzledom/id1261300725)

Built to teach myself JavaScript and CSS

This version is depricated and unused, check out the rewrite [here!](https://github.com/zvandermeer/Gradient-Swap-Rewritten)
